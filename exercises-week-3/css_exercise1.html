				To apply CSS to an element you need to select it. CSS provides you with a number of different ways to do
				this, and you can explore them in this module.
				<br>
				All HTML tags have styles associated with them.
				<br>
			</p>
			<p id="paragraph-two" class="article-one--p">
				Using a class selector gives you the ability to setup an independent style that you can then apply to
				any HTML Tag.
				<br>
				Unlike an HTML selector, which automatically targets a specific tag, a class is given a unique name that
				is then specified using the sytle attribute in the HTML tag or tags you want to use it in.
				<br>For example:
				<br>
				<span id="example-container">
					<span id="author-name">p.authorName</span>

					<span class="braces">{</span>
					<span id="css-property-value">font-size: 1em;</span>
					<span class="braces">}</span>
				</span>

				<h3>To define an HTML selector:</h3>
				<p>
					Start with the HTML selector whose properties yiou want to define. Add a curly bracket to open your
					rule. Make sure you always close your declaration list with a curly bracket.
				</p>

				<h3>To define a class selector:</h3>

				<p>

					Type a period (.) and a class name, then open and close your decalration block with curly brackets.

			<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Attribute Selectors"</h2>
			<p>
				You can look for elements that have a certain HTML attribute, or have a certain value for an HTML
				attribute, using the attribute selector.
				<br>
				Instruct CSS to look for attributes by wrapping the selector with square brackets
				(<span id="brackets">[ ]</span>).

				<br>
				<span id="attrib-select-wrapper">
					<span id="attrib-selector">[ data-type='primary' ]</span>{
					<span id="selector-value">color: blue;
					</span>}
				</span>
				<br>
				This CSS looks for all elements that have an attribute of data-type with a value of primary, like this:
				<br>
				&lt;div data-type="primary"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
			</p>

			<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Action PseudoClass Selectors"</h2>
			<p id="art-3-p1">
				HTML elements find themselves in various states, either because they are interacted with, or one of
				their child elements is in a certain state.
			</p>
			<p id="art-3-p2">
				For example, an HTML element could be hovered with the mouse pointer by a user or a child element could
				also be hovered by the user. For those situations, use the
				<span>:hover</span>
				pseudo-class.

			<h3>
				Pseudo-element #
			</h3>
			Pseudo-elements differ from pseudo-classes because instead of responding to the platform state, they act as
			if they are inserting a new element with CSS. Pseudo-elements are also syntactically different from
			pseudo-classes, because instead of using a single colon (<span>:</span>), we use a double colon
			(<span>::</span>)

			<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Combinators Selectors"</h2>

			<p id="art-4-p1">
				A combinator is what sits between two selectors. For example, if the selector was p > strong, the
				combinator is the > character. The selectors which use these combinators help you select items based on
				their position in the document.

			<p id="art-4-p2">
			<h3>Descendant combinator #</h3>
			To understand descendant combinators, you need to first understand parent and child elements.
			</p>
			<p id="art-4-p3">
				&lt;p&gt;A paragraph of text with some &lt;/strong&gt; bold text for emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			</p>
			<p id="art-4-p4">
				The parent element is the &lt;p&gt; which contains text. Inside that &lt;p&gt; element is a
				&lt;strong&gt; element, making its content bold. Because it is inside the &lt;p&gt;, it is a child
				element.
