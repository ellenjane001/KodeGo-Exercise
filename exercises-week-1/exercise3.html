    <strong>MANILA, Philippines</strong> — Only five families affected by
    Typhoon “Henry” now remain in evacuation centers, the National Disaster
    Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported on Wednesday.
    These families are currently staying in an evacuation center in Zambales,
    NDRRMC spokesperson and Office of Civil Defense (OCD) Assistant Secretary
    Raffy Alejandro said. Meanwhile, 11 other families who took temporary
    shelter with their relatives have also not yet returned to their homes, he
    added. The agency reported a total of almost 800 affected families due to
    the onslaught of Henry. The NDRRMC also cited that almost 200 families
    participated in the preemptive evacuation. Relief assistance from local
    government units were already distributed to those affected by the
    typhoon, Alejandro said. “Although nag-preposition tayo, ang nagamit
    talaga ay ‘yung mga nasa LGU [Local Government Unit], mga relief
    assistance. Ang na-release po as per our report is nasa almost 330 family
    food packs lang po ang nagamit or na-release po,” he noted. (Although we
    initiated, the relief assistance used was from LGU [Local Government
    Unit]. According to our report, we only distributed or used almost 330
    family food packs.) The agency also said one person was reported dead from
    drowning in a river in Ilocos Norte. Alejandro assured that financial and
    burial assistance will be given by the OCD to the family of the victim.
    “‘’Yung DSWD [Department of Social Welfare and Development], mayroon din
    silang binibigay na assistance diyan, and ‘yung DILG [Department of the
    Interior and Local Government] and LGU [Local Government Unit] mismo. Kung
    makumpleto ang mga papeles required and reports needed, maibibigay agad
    ang assistance,” he added. (The DSWD will also be providing assistance, as
    well as the DILG and LGU. If all the necessary papers and reports are
    already completed, the assistance will be urgently provided.) Alejandro
    stressed that Typhoon Henry, in general, had “very minimal” damage to its
    affected areas, particularly in Region 2, citing few to no damages in
    infrastructures. Typhoon Henry, with an international name of Hinnamor,
    already exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) last Sunday.
    Currently, NDRRMC is on standby in the implementation of its protocols as
    a preparation for an anticipated typhoon expected to enter the PAR. —

  <h2>Great time to invest, SMDC projects remain your best bet</h2>
  <em>Written By Vaughn Alviar</em>
  <p>
    Yes, it is the perfect time to invest in real estate. While recessions and
    inflation dominate the discussion today, Sheila Lobien of Lobien Realty
    Group Inc. (LRG) said during “InqTalks: A Dialogue with The Experts” that
    a foray into property would remain beneficial. Lobien is CEO at LRG, a
    full-service real estate consultancy and property investments strategy
    firm engaged in commercial and office space leasing, capital investments
    optimization, and property acquisition and sales. “Is this a good time to
    invest? Is this the best time? Yes, I’ll be upfront,” she said. “It is
    because prices of properties are relatively low, interest rate is still
    low and, if you do have a good credit standing, you can take that
    opportunity and borrow from the bank, and look at best properties out
    there.” All these could go away soon as all five subsegments of the
    property market see recovery, she explained. These subsegments include the
    residential, office, warehousing, retail and hospitality sectors. Pricing
    will imminently rise to pre-pandemic levels for residential products. The
    office market, “the barometer of a growing economy,” is recovering well.
    Warehousing has boomed thanks to e-commerce, while retail and hospitality
    are expected to pick up as restrictions relax and the so-called “revenge
    economy” grips the country. “I’m sure you feel [the recovery] because,
    when you go out, it’s not a ghost town anymore. People are braver because
    a lot of Filipinos are now vaccinated, some are boosted,” Lobien said. “I
    hope there will be no more surge … but, so far, a lot of developers and us
    who are actively participating in the property market are quite confident
    that this is really the start of the recovery period.” The window of
    opportunity is closing swiftly in offices as the administration mandates a
    return to offices for the business process outsourcing industry before
    2022 ends, she said. Now is, thus, the best time to renegotiate rates with
    landlords and lock in longer lease periods. Lobien also wants end-users
    and investors to snag up dwellings now with developers “giving good
    payment terms, attractive discounts,” adding that “you don’t wanna buy
    when the market’s so hot and everyone’s participating … because prices of
    property will go through the roof again.” She noted SM Development Corp.
    (SMDC) for offering outstanding terms in mixed-use properties, projects
    regarded as resilient to economic slowdowns and convenient for occupants
    even in emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, SMDC has
    been hailed for its “integrated mall lifestyle” that ensures properties
    are not only modern and world-class, but also masterplanned to embrace the
    enduring mall culture in the country.
